<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This paper examines how external governance pressure affects the type of debt that firms issue. Consistent with a governance mechanism substitution effect, we find that an exogenous increase (decrease) in governance pressure from the product (takeover) market has a significant negative (positive) impact on the use of bank (public debt) financing over public debt (bank loan) issuance. Tests using changes in the strictness of loan covenants provide corroborative evidence. These findings are consistent with the notion that firms endogenously substitute governance mechanisms and that demand for creditor governance depends on the relative strength of alternative external governance mechanisms.Received May 18, 2016; editorial decision November 11, 2017 by Editor David Denis.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We study credit allocation across firms and its real effects during China’s economic stimulus plan of 2009–2010. We match confidential loan-level data from the nineteen largest Chinese banks with firm-level data on manufacturing firms. We document that the stimulus-driven credit expansion disproportionately favored state-owned firms and firms with a lower average product of capital, reversing the process of capital reallocation toward private firms that characterized China’s high growth before 2008. We argue that implicit government guarantees for state-connected firms become more prominent during recessions and can explain this reversal.Received August 23, 2017; editorial decision November 15, 2018 by Editor Philip Strahan.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>What has driven the dramatic rise in U.S. corporate cash? Using non-public data, we show that the run-up is not uniform across firms but is concentrated in the foreign subsidiaries of multinational firms. Standard precautionary motives explain only domestic cash holdings, not these burgeoning foreign cash balances. Falling foreign tax rates, coupled with relaxed restrictions on income shifting, are the root of the changing foreign cash patterns. Firms with intellectual property have the greatest ability to shift income to low tax jurisdictions, and their foreign subsidiaries are where we observe the largest accumulations of cash.Received September 6, 2017; editorial decision August 22, 2018 by Editor David Denis.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Launched in Summer 2012, the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program indirectly recapitalized European banks through its positive impact on periphery sovereign bonds. However, the stability reestablished in the banking sector did not fully translate into economic growth. We document zombie lending by banks that remained weakly capitalized even post-OMT. In turn, firms receiving loans used these funds not to undertake real economic activity, such as employment and investment, but to build cash reserves. Creditworthy firms in industries with a high zombie firm prevalence significantly suffered from this credit misallocation, which further slowed the economic recovery.Received March 21, 2018; editorial decision November 13, 2018 by Editor Philip Strahan.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Stock return volatility during the Great Depression has been labeled a “volatility puzzle” because the standard deviation of stock returns was 2 to 3 times higher than any other period in American history. We investigate this puzzle using a new series of building permits and leverage. Our results suggest that volatility in building permit growth and financial leverage largely explain the high level of stock volatility during the Great Depression. Markets factored in the possibility of a forthcoming economic disaster.Received September 30, 2017; editorial decision August 27, 2018 by Editor Philip E. Strahan.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>I exploit information in the cross-section of bid-ask spreads to develop a new measure of extreme event risk. Spreads embed tail risk information because liquidity providers require compensation for the possibility of sharp changes in asset values. I show that simple regressions relating spreads and trading volume to factor betas recover this information and deliver high-frequency tail risk estimates for common factors in stock returns. My methodology disentangles financial and aggregate market risks during the 2007–2008 financial crisis; quantifies jump risks associated with Federal Open Market Committee announcements; and anticipates an extreme liquidity shock before the 2010 Flash Crash.Received April 27, 2016; editorial decision August 10, 2018 by Editor Andrew Karolyi.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We develop a dynamic model with time variation in external equity financing costs and show that variation in these costs is important for the model to quantitatively capture the joint dynamics of firms’ asset prices, real quantities, and financial flows in the U.S. economy. Growth firms and high investment firms are less risky in equilibrium, because they can substitute more easily debt financing for equity financing when it becomes more costly to raise external equity, which are high marginal utility states. Using a model-implied proxy of aggregate equity issuance cost shocks, we provide empirical support for the model’s economic mechanism.Received August 7, 2017; editorial decision September 24, 2018 by Editor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We develop a tractable equilibrium asset pricing model with cumulative prospect theory (CPT) preferences. Using GMM on a sample of U.S. equity index option returns, we show that by introducing a single common probability weighting parameter for both tails of the return distribution, the CPT model can simultaneously generate the otherwise puzzlingly low returns on both out-of-the-money put and out-of-the-money call options as well as the high observed variance premium. In a dynamic setting, probability weighting and time-varying equity return volatility combine to match the observed time-series pattern of the variance premium.Received May 30, 2017; editorial decision August 10, 2018 by Editor Andrew Karolyi.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We study the impact of index investing on firm performance by examining the link between commodity indices and firms that use index commodities. Around 2004, commodity index investing dramatically increased. This event is referred to as the financialization of commodity markets. Following financialization, firms that use index commodities make worse production decisions, earn 40% lower profits, and have 6% higher costs. Consistent with a feedback channel in which market participants learn from prices, our results suggest that index investing distorts the price signal, thereby generating a negative externality that impedes firms’ ability to make production decisions.Received March 31, 2017; editorial decision July 5, 2018 by Editor Itay Goldstein.

We rely on semi-nonparametric estimation of a flexible auxiliary model in our structural estimation. Based on the market and aggregate consumption data, our estimation provides statistical support for asset pricing models with smooth ambiguity. Statistical model comparison shows that models with ambiguity, learning, and time-varying volatility are preferred to the long-run risk model.
